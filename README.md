The file Data contains all the data related to the experiment associated with the publication.

Data/samples: coral fragments (N = 108) were collected from six coral colony genotypes (genotype 19, genotype 201, genotype 203, genotype 20, genotype 52, genotype 204). Each fragment was assigned a random letter (e.g., A, B, C, etc). The coral genotypes 19, 201, and 203 hosted Cladocopium symbionts. The coral genotypes 20, 52, and 204 hosted Durusdinium symbionts. Coral fragments were organized on racks and kept in separate tanks (6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15). Each tank was associated with a temperature controller (3, 5, 7, 13, 24, 20). Each tank-controller combination corresponded to a specific treatment (Ambient or control and heat stress). The sampling timepoint column represents the timepoint (T0, T1, T2) at which each fragment was processed for analyses. 

Data/controller03SPandPV: temperature profiles for the ambient treatment; PV are actual temperature values.
Data/controller05SPandPV: temperature profiles for the ambient treatment; PV are actual temperature values.
Data/controller07SPandPV: temperature profiles for the heat treatment; PV are actual temperature values. 
Data/controller13SPandPV: temperature profiles for the heat treatment; PV are actual temperature values. 
Data/controller14SPandPV: temperature profiles for the ambient treatment; PV are actual temperature values.
Data/controller20SPandPV: temperature profiles for the heat treatment; PV are actual temperature values. 

Data/FvFm: photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) analysis; data collected to measure the maximum quantum yield (qy) of symbionts’ photosystem II using two hours dark-adapted coral fragments. Data were collected with an Imaging Pulse-Amplitude Modulation chlorophyll fluorometer (IPAM M-series, Walz, Germany) using ImagingWin software (v2.56zg) at each timepoint (T0, T1, T2) for all coral fragments in ambient (A) and heat (H) treatments.

Data/ros: reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis; ROS signal of symbionts in each coral fragment was measured in a plate reader with 545-nm absorption and 565-nm emission. Data were collected at each timepoint (T0, T1, T2) for all coral fragments in ambient (A) and heat (H) treatments.

Data/glycans: glycan analysis; fluorescent signal (Int) of the fluorescent molecular probes Alexa Fluor 488 and FITC associated with the lectins ConA (Concavalin A, specific for D-mannose and D-glucose; C21401, ThermoFisher scientific), LTL (Lotus tetragonolobus lectin, specific for L-fucose; L32480, ThermoFisher scientific) and PNA (Arachis hypogaea lectin, specific for D-galactose; L21409, ThermoFisher scientific). Lectins-associated fluorescent molecular probes were incubated with symbionts isolated from coral fragments at each timepoint (T0, T1, T2) in ambient (A) and heat (H) treatments. Data were collected with a Zeiss LSM-710 confocal microscope using Zeiss Zen Imaging Software (Black edition). The id column represents the coral genotype-fragment-microscope slide well.
